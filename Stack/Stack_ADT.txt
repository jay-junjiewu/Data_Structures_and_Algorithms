Stack is a linear data structure in which insertions and deletions are only allowed
at the end, called the top of the stack
Works on the principle of LIFO, last in first out.
All operations on stack should take O(1)

Primary stack operations
    push(data): inserts data onto the stack
    pop(): delete and returns the last inserted element from the stack (top most element)

Secondary stack operations
    top(): returns the last inserted element without removing it (top most element)
    size(): returns the number of elements in the stack
    isEmpty(): returns true if stack is empty
    isFull(): returns true if stack is full
