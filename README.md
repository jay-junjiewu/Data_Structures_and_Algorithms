# About
The purpose of this repository is to document :writing_hand: my progress in learning ***Data Structures and Algorithms*** :nerd_face:. 

This course is not a core requirement for my electrical engineering :zap: degree but I find them interesting so here is my attempt at learning them on my own :woozy_face:.

These topics do not follow a typical university course structure.....actually I intend to include all topics that are included in the university course description 
along with a combination of additional topics that I find interesting _merged_ together...
hopefully there are no _merge conflicts_...:laughing: (please excuse that).

This repository is more like a personal notebook/journal/experiment (_still not sure what to call it_) than a project.
I have decided to keep this as a reference that I can revisit and review if these topics ever become useful in the future :thinking:.....I'll find out......

Disclaimer: I wrote most of the code myself, although some may have been _"inspired"_ :eyes: by external sources like StackOverflow/StackExchange/ChatGPT/Reddit/GitHub.... :man_shrugging:.
