Queue is a linear data structure in which insertions can be done at the tail (rear)
and deletion can be done at head (front)
Works on the principle of FIFO, first in first out.
All operations on queue should take O(1)

Primary queue opertaions
    enqueue(data)/push(data): inserts data into the queue
    dequeue()/pop(): deletes and returns the head of the queue (top most element)

Secondary queue operations
    front()/peek(): returns the head
    size(): returns the number of elements in the queue
    isEmpty(): returns true if queue is empty
    isFull(): returns true if queue is full
